                During my internship, I want to learn more about User Experience Design, Security best practices,
                Software architecture, software life cycle, CI/CD and more. Software is playing a huge role in
                shaping our society, and I really want to be part of it. I do not care about what project I am in
                as long as that project will benefit the society. It will mean the world to me if I can
                see my few lines of codes send the human back to the moon, or in fully self-driving vehicle or just
                in other areas of software that affect the society.
